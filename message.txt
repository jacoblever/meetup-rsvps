*Indoors Frisbee this winter*
We have booked an indoor basketball court for indoors this winter! Our slot is *Thursdays, 6-8pm*, so the same time as summer frisbee.
Thur 23rd (this Thursday) will be our first session.

*Cost*
For indoors, sadly, we have to pay for the hall 🙁 It'll cost £5 per session, so cheaper than a pint...

*How do I sign up?*
We will open sign up *tomorrow* (Sunday 19th) at *11am* for *all sessions before Christmas at once*. There will be 18 slots per session, so get online early to sign up (you'll have to click attending on every session you want to go to, sorry for the amount of clicking!), and then DM me to pay for all your sessions.

If we are over subscribed we'll figure something out, but in previous years ~4 people have dropped out each week and most people on the meetup waitlist have been able to play 🙂
